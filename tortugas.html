  <p> There are many things that man kind are doing that destoy the ecoasyatem and the way of life of this creutues.</p>
  the three main ones, and the ones im going to talk about are
   <ul>
     <li> Pollution</li>
     <li> Plastics </li>
     <li> Hottest sands</li>
</div>
<div class="hello99">
    <h1>Plastic</h1>
    <p>Each year, more than six million tons of waste reach the ocean and 90% of these products are plastics.
      Turtles can become tangled and ingest marine debris,
      <<h3>What is Marine debris?</h3>
       <li>Anything man-made that once its lost or thrown into the ocean. For example:
          </li>
          <li>  litter and fishing gear.</li>
          <li>plastics</li>
          <li>glass</li>
          <li>cloth and rubber</li>
          which threatens their ability to feed, grow and, as a result, their survival.
  </div>
<div class="lol2">
  <h2>Hot Sands</h2>
 <p>The sex of the turtle pups depends on the temperature of the sand where the eggs are laid.
   Climate change can cause temperatures to rise. Higher temperatures could cause the sand to heat up, which would cause an increase in more of female offspring.</p>
   <h3>Intesting fact?!</h3>
   <p>One study concluded that it would be possible that southern populations of turtles in the US will be female populations if the temperature rose by only 1 Â° C.</p>

<div class="hello99">
  <h2>Pollution</h2>
  <p>Solid waste, chemicals and pollutants from human activities reach the sea, causing injuries, diseases and even the death of sea turtles.
    <li>Thousands of chemicals produced by humans pollute the sea, and many of them accumulate in turtle tissues, affecting their locomotion, brain function and even reproduction. </li>
    <li>Sea turtles also ingest plastics and plastic waste, which can damage your digestive system. </li>

</div>
<div class="lol2">
  <h2>Solutions?</h2>
  <p> acordding to this website, some solutions you could do would be...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Become a conscious and responsible seafood consumer by asking where and how your seafood was caught. Choose seafood caught in ways that do not harm or kill turtles. Consult sustainable seafood information networks to learn about how and where your seafood is caught.</li>
    <li>Support sea turtle conservation by getting involved. Support actions that help sea turtles.</li>
    <li>Participate in coastal clean-ups and reduce plastic use to keep our beaches and ocean clean. Trash in the ocean can harm sea turtles and other creatures that live there.</li>
    <li>Do not disturb nesting turtles, nests, or hatchlings. Attend organized sea turtle watches that know how to safely observe nesting sea turtles.</li>
