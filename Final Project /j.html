  <p>Let me tell you a little about me. I grew up in a very small town in Ecaudor. Where my school didnt have
    the best learning system nor the best teclolongy. I came to this class with ZERO expience, but thsi has turly been my favorte class from the start. i am very gratful to have taken this class and i will continue to presude with classes like this.
  Now lest talk about some stugles and how i ovecame them. Sinc i had no expience with coumputes nor the gearte sence of style. creating a website where i was the one who had to srta from scatch was very difivult. it took me and still takes me a long time to create one, but i really enjoy the proggces.  </p>
  <h5>in the menu bar you will see all my work that im poaud and have worred really hard. </h5>
