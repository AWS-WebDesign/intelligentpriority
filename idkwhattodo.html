    <h1>What is the difrence between an Ape and a Monkey?! </h1>
    <p> The quickest way to tell the difference
      between a monkey and an ape is by the presence or absence of a tail.
</div>
<br>
<div class="funcy">

       Almost all monkeys have tails;
      apes do not. Their bodies are different in other ways too: monkeys are generally smaller and narrow-chested,
      while apes are larger and have broad
      chests and shoulder joints that allow them to swing
      through trees (while some monkeys also have this ability, most of them are
      built for running across branches rather than swinging). </p>
