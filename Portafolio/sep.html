<h2>Recuring Dream</h2>
<h4>Sep 4, 2019</h4>
<p>This was the 1st website I ever created, as you can see, it has a <br>
  background image and different styles of text.
  This was because we went back to it to implement "CSS". The main goal of this website was to implement the things we learn during that day.</p>

<body style="text-align:center;">
  <div class="tooltip"><img src="rc.png" alt="">
  <span class="tooltiptext">It took me exactly 15 minutes to create and about 10min figure put how to upload in Github</span>

<h2>Animal Web Page</h2>
<h4>Sep 9, 2019</h4>

format and the understating of div.  </p>

  <span class="tooltiptext">The colors chosen here were with the purpose to create life to the page. </span>
