      <p>Animations were something that fascinated me and was desperate to know how to use it. What I believe was the hardest was the understanding of the timing and how to connect it. </p>

     <p>This was and still is confusing. I believe i don't quite get it... and it's quite obvious with the way the snowman should look. This is something I'm looking to have a better understanding.    </p>

      <p>This was a project done by Pauline and I. This was interesting because we focused a lot on getting the animation working and as well as the quiz. But it was also interesting because we got to gain information about social media.</p>
