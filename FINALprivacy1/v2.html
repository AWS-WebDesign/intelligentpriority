<h2>WHAT privacy are you guaranteed on the internet?</h2>
  <h2>Short answer? None. Unless there is an agreement, or privacy policy in place,
  your information is never truly safe. Companies tracking your search activity,
  purchases, and activity is more common than you think.
  <br> Read through this website
to find out if and how to protect yourself from these occurences.</h2>

  <p>Who is collecting data?</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>
  <h2>So now, you might be wondering WHO or what entities are collecting information,
  and through what means?
<br>
<br>
  Internet privacy risks include:
  <br>
  <br>
1. Phishing: An Internet hacking activity used to steal secure user data, including username, password, bank account number, security PIN or credit card number.
<br>
<br>
2. Pharming: An Internet hacking activity used to redirect a legitimate website visitor to a different IP address.
<br>
<br>
3. Spyware: An offline application that obtains data without a user's consent. When the computer is online, previously acquired data is sent to the spyware source.
<br>
<br>
4. Malware: An application used to illegally damage online and offline computer users through Trojans, viruses and spyware.

  <p>Why are they collecting data?</p>

<br>

<h2>Well, YOU agree to it. Have you ever downloaded an app, and been asked to agree to a privacy policy? Probably.
Now, have you read through those pages? The answer is probably not. Technically, a company could put in whatever they would like,
as long as it isn't illegal, and you consent to them collecting your information. Did you know that when you sign up for a Youtube account,
their privacy policy actually ALLOWS them to base ads off of your most frequent google searches. If privacy is important to you, you might
want to read through these agreements, to see what you're getting yourself into.
<br>
<br>
So why do they want your information?
<br>
<br>
1. To use your searches and interests to customize ads and boost sponsors' activity.
<br>
<br>
2. Monitor activity and use of features on their website as a way to determine what is/isn't successful.
<br>
<br>
3. Give the user a better experience.
<br>
<br>
It isn't always used in negative ways, as often, your acitivity and information can actually help an enitity. This isn't the case with
independent hackers, but as we've learned, there are ways to prevent this.
