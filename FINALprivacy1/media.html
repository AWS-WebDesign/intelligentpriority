<h2>What information do they collect?</h2>
<h3>
1. Information you provide.
<br>
<br>
2. Information they get when you use their services.
<br>
<br>
3. Information they get from third parties.
<br>
<br>
Here’s a little more detail on each of these categories.
<br>
<br>
<!-- bolds the words-->
<strong>Information You Provide:</strong>
<br>
<br>
When you interact with their services, they collect information that you provide to them. For example, most of their services require you to set up a Snapchat account, so they need to collect a few important details about you, such as your name, username, password, email address, phone number, and date of birth. They may also ask you to provide them with some additional information that will be publicly visible on their services, such as a profile picture or Bitmoji avatar. Other services, such as commerce products, may require you to provide us with a debit or credit card number and its associated account information.
<br>
<br>
Of course, you’ll also provide them whatever information you send through our services, such as Snaps and Chats. Keep in mind that the users who view your Snaps, Chats, and any other content can always save that content or copy it outside the app.
Most users don't know this, but snapchat saves every single snap that you send, regardless of its contents.
<br>
<br>
When you contact customer support or communicate with them in any other way, they'll collect whatever information you volunteer or that they need to resolve your question.</h3>

<h2>What information do they collect?</h2>
<h3>
  1. Your username, password and e-mail address when you register for an Instagram account.
  <br>
  <br>
  2. Profile information that you provide for your user profile (e.g., first and last name, picture, phone number). This information allows us to help you or others be "found" on Instagram.
  <br>
  <br>
  3. User Content (e.g., photos, comments, and other materials) that you post to the Service.
  <br>
  <br>
  4. Communications between you and Instagram. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service)

<h3>In fact, since Instragram merged with Faeboook in 2012, they have been suspected to become more secretive about their privacy policy.
Most of their policy is written in legalese, which is legal language, that would be too hard for a common user to understand. As a user, you
must understand that the messages, images, and posts that you put on this platform are never truly gone.</h3>

<h2>What information do they collect?</h2>
Your public data: Facebook allows you to make certain information private, or to make all of your information public. However, even if you adju
st your privacy settings to make everything private
, some information is public, no matter what you
do. All public information can be seen by anyone,
 even if they do not have a Facebook account. And “anyone” includes other websites, games, and various Web applications. Always-public information – what Facebook
 refers to as your “basic info” — includes:
<br>
<br>
1. Name
<br>
2. Profile pictures
<br>
3. Cover photos
<br>
4. Gender
<br>
5. Username
<br>
6. User ID
<br>
7. Comments made on public websites that use Facebook’s commenting plug-in
<br>
8. Comments made on public websites through Facebook’s commenting plug-in about you by other people.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Facebook is very different from other apps, in that anyone cans ee your profile. Unless you block them,
all of this public information can be seen. Facebook is also known to have ver loose activity policies,
in that you authorize them to connect your instagram acitivity to your facebook ads. As discussed, this
helps boost their sposors, and subsequenty, their income. </h3>
